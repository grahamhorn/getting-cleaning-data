# Code Book
The experiment design is summarized in the README.txt file in the zip file. See that file for further information.


## Variables
The following description is taken from the features_info.txt file contained in the zip file.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The following variables are contained within the tidy data set, these are estimates of the mean value and standard deviations from these signals.

The data set also contains the labels for activity and subject.

## Data
The first tidy data set consists of 10299 observations of 81 variables (listed above).

The second data set (with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject) consists of 180 observations of 81 variables

## Transformations
The data in the original zip file contains training and test data sets. These have been merged together. 

Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement have been kept.

The subject and activity labels were added as additional columns. The activity coding was replaced by the labels provided in the zip file.

The script also produces a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
